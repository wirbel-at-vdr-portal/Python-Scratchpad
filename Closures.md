# Closures
Closures are useful to **avoid global vars**, but rather *hiding those values* them inside a function variable.  
Actually, this is a kind of special Python thing, i guess. It's also a bit hard to understand.

* A *function*, returning it's [Nested Function](Functions.md#Nested%20Functions), assigned to a variable together with the function argument, may be called a **Closure**.
