**#Coding Rules**

* **No semicolon at end of line.**
> [!NOTE]
> The line just ends.
* **Indent is 4 (four) spaces.**
> [!NOTE]
> Tab is accepted, i just dislike Tabs.
* **Code Blocks** (if/else, loops, functions, ..) are formed by **indent**, instead of curly braces. 
* **Comments** are done with '#'.
* **multiple Assignments** in a single row are possible:
```
   a, b = 3, 4
   print(a, b)
   # a = 3, b = 4
```
