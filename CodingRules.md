**#Coding Rules**

* **No semicolon at end of line.** The line just ends.
* **Indent is 4 (four) spaces.** Tab is accepted, but i don't like Tabs.
* **Code Blocks** (if/else, loops, functions, ..)  
    *Blocks are formed by **indent**, instead of curly braces.*
* **Comments** are done with '#'.
* **multiple Assignments** in a single row
```
a, b = 3, 4
print(a, b)
# a = 3, b = 4
```
