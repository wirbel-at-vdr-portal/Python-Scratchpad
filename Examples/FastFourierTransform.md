# Fast Fourier Transform

One of math use cases in advanced Electronice Engineering is the *Fast Fourier Transformation*.  
The basic idea beind is, that we have an algorithm, with translates a signal from time domain into an equivalent in frequency domain. Actualy, we are not working on the signal itself, but rather on a number of samples of the original signal in equidistant points in time and convert it to a series of frequency samples.
