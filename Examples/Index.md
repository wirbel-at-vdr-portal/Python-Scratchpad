# Examples

Trying to learn a language would be useless to me, until I try to *practice*.  
Only practice may raise new questions beyond the very basic tutorials found in the net.  
These examples are **my first steps** into *tiny Python programs*. 

Not yet using *Pythonisms*, but rather a mixing other languages while doing *first steps* is *unavoidable*.
