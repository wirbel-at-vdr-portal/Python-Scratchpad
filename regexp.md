# Regular Expressions (regexp)

Regular expressions are supported in the **re** module.

[here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax%22RE%20syntax) is the official documentation for it.

As long as i have any other option, i'm going to avoid regexp.

To be completed later.
